## Introduction

Stable Diffusion is a powerful model designed for generating images from textual descriptions. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to leverage Stable Diffusion in your projects, enabling you to create stunning visual content from simple text inputs.

## Stable Diffusion

### Overview

Stable Diffusion is a type of generative model that is particularly effective for creating high-quality images from textual descriptions. It leverages the principles of diffusion models, which iteratively refine a noisy image until it matches the target description.

### Architecture

The architecture of Stable Diffusion involves several key components:

1. **Text Encoder**: Converts the input text into a dense, high-dimensional representation.
2. **Image Decoder**: Uses the encoded text representation to generate an initial noisy image.
3. **Diffusion Process**: Iteratively refines the noisy image through a series of denoising steps, guided by the encoded text, to produce a final high-quality image.
4. **Loss Function**: Measures the difference between the generated image and the target image, guiding the training process to improve the model's performance.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aayush1693/Stable-Diffusion-Image-Generation.git
cd Stable-Diffusion-Image-Generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate images using Stable Diffusion, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your text descriptions in a text file or directly input them through a script.
2. Run the image generation script with your text descriptions as input.

Example:

```python
from stable_diffusion import generate_image

text_description = "A beautiful sunset over the mountains."
image = generate_image(text_description)
image.save("output.png")
```

## Acknowledgments

This project is built upon the foundational work of the creators of Stable Diffusion. I would like to express my gratitude to the original authors and contributors who made this technology possible. Your groundbreaking work has inspired and enabled countless projects, including this one.
